This section explains the concepts of generative AI scale unit (GSU) and burndown rates. Provisioned Throughput is calculated and priced using generative AI scale units (GSUs) and burndown rates.

## GSU and burndown rate

A *Generative AI Scale Unit (GSU)* is a measure of throughput for your prompts and responses. This amount specifies how much throughput to provision a model with.

A *burndown rate* is a ratio that converts the input and output units (such as tokens, characters, or images) to input tokens per second, input characters per second, or input images per second, respectively. This ratio represents the throughput and is used to produce a standard unit across models.

Different models use different amounts of throughput. For information about the minimum GSU purchase amount and increments for each model, see [Supported models and burndown rates](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/models/provisioned-throughput/supported-models) in this document.

This equation demonstrates how throughput is calculated:

    inputs_per_query = inputs_across_modalities_converted_using_burndown_rates
    outputs_per_query = outputs_across_modalities_converted_using_burndown_rates
    
    throughput_per_second = (inputs_per_query + outputs_per_query) * queries_per_second

The calculated throughput per second determines how many GSUs that you need for your use case.

## Important Considerations

To help you plan for your Provisioned Throughput needs, review the following important considerations:

  - **Requests are prioritized.**
    
    Provisioned Throughput customers are prioritized and serviced first before on-demand requests.

  - **Throughput doesn't accumulate.**
    
    Unused throughput doesn't accumulate or carry over to the next month.

  - **Provisioned Throughput is measured in tokens per second, characters per second, or images per second.**
    
    Provisioned Throughput isn't measured solely based on queries per minute (QPM). It's measured based on the query size for your use case, the response size, and the QPM.

  - **Provisioned Throughput is specific to a project, region, model, and version.**
    
    Provisioned Throughput is assigned to a specific project-region-model-version combination. The same model called from a different region won't count against your Provisioned Throughput quota and won't be prioritized over on-demand requests.

### Context caching

> **Preview**
> 
> This feature is subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section of the [Service Specific Terms](https://docs.cloud.google.com/terms/service-terms#1) . Pre-GA features are available "as is" and might have limited support. For more information, see the [launch stage descriptions](https://cloud.google.com/products/#product-launch-stages) .

Provisioned Throughput supports [implicit caching](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/models/context-cache/context-cache-overview#implicit-caching) and [explicit caching](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/models/context-cache/context-cache-overview#explicit-caching) . For information about supported models and limits, see [Context caching](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/models/context-cache/context-cache-overview) .

Implicit caching is enabled in all Google Cloud projects, by default. Implicit caching reduces cost and latency during cache hits. Cached tokens are charged at a [discount](https://cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/generative-ai/pricing) relative to standard input tokens when a cache hit occurs. Explicit caching offers more control and ensures a discount when explicit caches are referenced. To learn how to create a context cache for explicit caching, see [Create a context cache](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/models/context-cache/context-cache-create) . To view model-specific discounts, see [Context caching overview](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/models/context-cache/context-cache-overview) . For Provisioned Throughput, the discount is applied through a reduced burndown rate.

For example, Gemini 2.5 Pro has the following burndown rates for input text tokens and cached tokens:

  - 1 input text token = 1 token

  - 1 input cached text token = 0.1 tokens

Sending 1,000 input tokens to this model results in a burndown of your Provisioned Throughput by 1,000 input tokens per second. However, if you send 1,000 cached tokens to Gemini 2.5 Pro, this results in a burndown of your Provisioned Throughput by 100 tokens per second.

Note that this can lead to higher throughput for similar queries where the tokens aren't cached and the cache discount isn't applied.

To view the burndown rates for models supported in Provisioned Throughput, see [Supported models and burndown rates](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/models/provisioned-throughput/supported-models) .

## Understand the burndown for Gemini Live API

Provisioned Throughput supports the Gemini 2.5 Flash with Gemini Live API. To understand how to calculate the burndown while using the Gemini Live API, see [Calculate throughput for Gemini Live API](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/models/provisioned-throughput/live-api#calculate) .

## Example of estimating your Provisioned Throughput needs

To estimate your Provisioned Throughput needs, use the [estimation tool in the Google Cloud console](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/models/provisioned-throughput/purchase-provisioned-throughput#estimate-provisioned-throughput) . The following example illustrates the process of estimating the amount of Provisioned Throughput for your model. The region isn't considered in the estimation calculations.

This table provides the burndown rates for Gemini 3.6 Flash that you can use to follow the example.

1 input image caching token = 0.1 tokens<br />

1.  **Gather your requirements.** In this example, your requirement is to verify that you can support 10 queries per second (QPS) of a query with an input of 1,000 text tokens and 500 audio tokens, to receive an output of 300 text response tokens using `gemini-3.6-flash` .
    
    To calculate your throughput for your specific use case, use the [burndown rates](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/models/provisioned-throughput/supported-models#google-models) for your selected model.

2.  **Calculate your throughput.** Multiply your inputs by the burndown rates to arrive at total input tokens:
    
    $\\text{1,000} \\times (\\text{1 token per input text token}) + \\text{500} \\times (\\text{1 token per input audio token}) = \\text{1,500}$ burndown adjusted input tokens per query.
    
    Multiply your outputs by the burndown rates to arrive at total output tokens:
    
    $\\text{300} \\times (\\text{5 tokens per output text response token}) = \\text{1,500}$ burndown adjusted output tokens per query.
    
    Add your totals together:
    
    $\\text{1,500 burndown adjusted input tokens} + \\text{1,500 burndown adjusted output tokens} = \\text{3,000}$ total tokens per query.
    
    Multiply the total number of tokens by the QPS to arrive at total throughput per second:
    
    $\\text{3,000 total tokens per query} \\times \\text{10 QPS} = \\text{30,000}$ total tokens per second.

3.  **Calculate your needed GSUs.** The GSUs are the total tokens per second divided by the per-second throughput per GSU from the burndown table:
    
    $\\text{30,000 total tokens per second} \\div \\text{675 per-second throughput per GSU} = \\text{44.44}$ GSUs.
    
    The minimum GSU purchase increment for `gemini-3.6-flash` is **1** , so you'll need **45 GSUs** to assure your workload.
