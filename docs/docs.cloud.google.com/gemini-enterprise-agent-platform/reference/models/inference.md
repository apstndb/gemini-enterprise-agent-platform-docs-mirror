Use `generateContent` or `streamGenerateContent` to generate content with Gemini.

The Gemini model family includes models that work with multimodal prompt requests. The term multimodal indicates that you can use more than one modality, or type of input, in a prompt. Models that aren't multimodal accept prompts only with text. Modalities can include text, audio, video, and more.

## Get started

To get started generating content with Gemini, do the following:

1.  [Create a Google Cloud account](https://console.cloud.google.com/freetrial?redirectPath=/marketplace/product/google/cloudaicompanion.googleapis.com) .

2.  Review this document to learn about the Gemini model [request body](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/reference/models/inference#request) , [parameters](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/reference/models/inference#parameters) , and [response body](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/reference/models/inference#response) . To see some sample requests, see [Examples](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/reference/models/inference#sample-requests) .

3.  To learn how to send a request to the Gemini API by using a programming language SDK or the REST API, see the [Gemini API quickstart](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/models/start) .

## Supported models

All Gemini models support content generation.

> **Note:** Adding a lot of images to a request increases response latency.

## Parameter list

See [examples](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/reference/models/inference#sample-requests) for implementation details.

The request body contains data with the following parameters:

Parameters

`cachedContent`

Optional: `string`

The name of the cached content used as context to serve the prediction. Format: `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/cachedContents/{cachedContent}`

`contents`

Required: `Content`

The content of the current conversation with the model.

For single-turn queries, this is a single instance. For multi-turn queries, this is a repeated field that contains conversation history and the latest request.

`systemInstruction`

Optional: `Content`

Available for `gemini-2.0-flash` and `gemini-2.0-flash-lite` .

Instructions for the model to steer it toward better performance. For example, "Answer as concisely as possible" or "Don't use technical terms in your response".

The `text` strings count toward the token limit.

The `role` field of `systemInstruction` is ignored and doesn't affect the performance of the model.

> **Note:** Only `text` should be used in `parts` and content in each `part` should be in a separate paragraph.

`tools`

Optional. A piece of code that enables the system to interact with external systems to perform an action, or set of actions, outside of knowledge and scope of the model. See [Function calling](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/reference/models/function-calling) .

`toolConfig`

Optional: `GenerationConfig`

Generation configuration settings.

`labels`

Optional: `string`

Metadata that you can add to the API call in the format of key-value pairs.

#### `contents`

The base structured data type containing multi-part content of a message.

This class consists of two main properties: `role` and `parts` . The `role` property denotes the individual producing the content, while the `parts` property contains multiple elements, each representing a segment of data within a message.

Parameters

`role`

`string`

The identity of the entity that creates the message. The following values are supported:

  - `user` : This indicates that the message is sent by a real person, typically a user-generated message.
  - `model` : This indicates that the message is generated by the model.

The `model` value is used to insert messages from the model into the conversation during multi-turn conversations.

`parts`

`Part`

A list of ordered parts that make up a single message. Different parts may have different [IANA MIME types](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xml) .

For limits on the inputs, such as the maximum number of tokens or the number of images, see the model specifications on the [Google models](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/models/google-models) page.

To compute the number of tokens in your request, see [Get token count](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/models/capabilities/get-token-count) .

#### `parts`

A data type containing media that is part of a multi-part `Content` message.

Parameters

`text`

Optional: `string`

A text prompt or code snippet.

`inlineData`

Optional: `Blob`

Inline data in raw bytes.

For `gemini-2.0-flash-lite` and `gemini-2.0-flash` , you can specify up to 3000 images by using `inlineData` .

`fileData`

Optional: `fileData`

Data stored in a file.

`functionCall`

Optional: `FunctionCall` .

It contains a string representing the `FunctionDeclaration.name` field and a structured JSON object containing any parameters for the function call predicted by the model.

See [Function calling](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/reference/models/function-calling) .

`functionResponse`

Optional: `FunctionResponse` .

The result output of a `FunctionCall` that contains a string representing the `FunctionDeclaration.name` field and a structured JSON object containing any output from the function call. It is used as context to the model.

See [Function calling](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/reference/models/function-calling) .

`thought`

Optional: `boolean`

Indicates whether the part represents the model's thought process or reasoning.

`thoughtSignature`

Optional: `string (bytes format)`

An opaque signature for the thought so it can be reused in subsequent requests. A base64-encoded string.

`videoMetadata`

Optional: `VideoMetadata`

For video input, the start and end offset of the video in [Duration](https://protobuf.dev/reference/protobuf/google.protobuf/#duration) format, and the frame rate of the video . For example, to specify a 10 second clip starting at 1:00 with a frame rate of 10 frames per second, set the following:

  - `"startOffset": { "seconds": 60 }`
  - `"endOffset": { "seconds": 70 }`
  - `"fps": 10.0`

The metadata should only be specified while the video data is presented in `inlineData` or `fileData` .

`mediaResolution`

Optional: `MediaResolution`

Per-part media resolution for the input media. Controls how input media is processed. If specified, this overrides the `mediaResolution` setting in `generationConfig` . `LOW` reduces tokens per image/video, possibly losing detail but allowing longer videos in context. Supported values: `HIGH` , `MEDIUM` , `LOW` .

#### `blob`

Content blob. If possible send as text rather than raw bytes.

Parameters

`mimeType`

`string`

The media type of the file specified in the `data` or `fileUri` fields. Acceptable values include the following:

`BLOCK_MEDIUM_AND_ABOVE`

Block medium threshold and higher.

`BLOCK_ONLY_HIGH`

Block only high threshold (i.e. block less).

`BLOCK_NONE`

Block none.

`OFF`

`SEVERITY`

The harm block method uses both probability and severity scores.

`PROBABILITY`

The harm block method uses the probability score.

#### `generationConfig`

Configuration settings used when generating the prompt.

Parameters

`temperature`

Optional: `float`

The range of values and default value is specific for each model. See the [temperature ranges and default values list](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/reference/models/inference#temperature-ranges) .

The temperature is used for sampling during response generation, which occurs when `topP` and `topK` are applied. Temperature controls the degree of randomness in token selection. Lower temperatures are good for prompts that require a less open-ended or creative response, while higher temperatures can lead to more diverse or creative results. A temperature of `0` means that the highest probability tokens are always selected. In this case, responses for a given prompt are mostly deterministic, but a small amount of variation is still possible.

If the model returns a response that's too generic, too short, or the model gives a fallback response, try increasing the temperature. If the model enters infinite generation, increasing the temperature to at least `0.1` may lead to improved results.

`1.0` is the recommended starting value for temperature.

<span id="temperature-ranges"></span>

  - Range for `gemini-2.0-flash-lite` : `0.0 - 2.0` (default: `1.0` )
  - Range for `gemini-2.0-flash` : `0.0 - 2.0` (default: `1.0` )
  - Range for `Gemini 3` : `0.0 - 2.0` (default: `1.0` )

> **Note:** Sampling parameters ( `temperature` , `topP` , and `topK` ) are deprecated for all `Gemini 3` models. It is recommended to omit these parameters and let the model manage sampling automatically.

For more information, see [Content generation parameters](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/models/capabilities/content-generation-parameters#temperature) .

`topP`

Optional: `float`

If specified, nucleus sampling is used.

[Top-P](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/models/capabilities/content-generation-parameters#top-p) changes how the model selects tokens for output. Tokens are selected from the most (see top-K) to least probable until the sum of their probabilities equals the top-P value. For example, if tokens A, B, and C have a probability of 0.3, 0.2, and 0.1 and the top-P value is `0.5` , then the model will select either A or B as the next token by using temperature and excludes C as a candidate.

Specify a lower value for less random responses and a higher value for more random responses.

  - Range: `0.0 - 1.0`
  - Default for `gemini-2.0-flash-lite` : `0.95`
  - Default for `gemini-2.0-flash` : `0.95`

`topK`

Optional: `float`

Specifies the top-k sampling threshold. The model considers only the top k most probable tokens for the next token. This can be useful for generating more coherent and less random text. For example, a \`topK\` of 40 means the model will choose the next word from the 40 most likely words.

`candidateCount`

Optional: `int`

The number of response variations to return. For each request, you're charged for the output tokens of all candidates, but are only charged once for the input tokens.

Specifying multiple candidates is a Preview feature that works with `generateContent` ( `streamGenerateContent` is not supported). The following models are supported:

  - `gemini-2.0-flash-lite` : `1` - `8` , default: `1`
  - `gemini-2.0-flash` : `1` - `8` , default: `1`

`maxOutputTokens`

Optional: int

Maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the response. A token is approximately four characters. 100 tokens correspond to roughly 60-80 words.

Specify a lower value for shorter responses and a higher value for potentially longer responses.

For more information, see [Content generation parameters](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/models/capabilities/content-generation-parameters#max-output-tokens) .

`stopSequences`

Optional: `List[string]`

Specifies a list of strings that tells the model to stop generating text if one of the strings is encountered in the response. If a string appears multiple times in the response, then the response is truncated where it's first encountered. The strings are case-sensitive.  
  
For example, if the following is the returned response when `stopSequences` isn't specified:  
  
`public static string reverse(string myString)`  
  
Then the returned response with `stopSequences` set to `["Str", "reverse"]` is:  
  
`public static string`

Maximum 5 items in the list.

For more information, see [Content generation parameters](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/models/capabilities/content-generation-parameters#stop-sequences) .

`presencePenalty`

Optional: `float`

Positive penalties.

Positive values penalize tokens that already appear in the generated text, increasing the probability of generating more diverse content.

The maximum value for `presencePenalty` is up to, but not including, `2.0` . Its minimum value is `-2.0` .

`frequencyPenalty`

Optional: `float`

Positive values penalize tokens that repeatedly appear in the generated text, decreasing the probability of repeating content.

This maximum value for `frequencyPenalty` is up to, but not including, `2.0` . Its minimum value is `-2.0` .

`responseMimeType`

Optional: `string (enum)`

The output response MIME type of the generated candidate text.

The following MIME types are supported:

  - `application/json` : JSON response in the candidates.
  - `text/plain` (default): Plain text output.
  - `text/x.enum` : For classification tasks, output an enum value as defined in the response schema.

Specify the appropriate response type to avoid unintended behaviors. For example, if you require a JSON-formatted response, specify `application/json` and not `text/plain` .

`text/plain` isn't supported for use with `responseSchema` .

`responseSchema`

Optional: [schema](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.cachedContents#Schema)

The schema that generated candidate text must follow. For more information, see [Control generated output](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/models/capabilities/control-generated-output) .

To use this parameter, you must specify a supported mime type other than `text/plain` for the `responseMimeType` parameter.

`seed`

Optional: `int`

When seed is fixed to a specific value, the model makes a best effort to provide the same response for repeated requests. Deterministic output isn't guaranteed. Also, changing the model or parameter settings, such as the temperature, can cause variations in the response even when you use the same seed value. By default, a random seed value is used.

`responseLogprobs`

Optional: `boolean`

If true, returns the log probabilities of the tokens that were chosen by the model at each step. By default, this parameter is set to `false` .

`logprobs`

Optional: `int`

Returns the log probabilities of the top candidate tokens at each generation step. The model's chosen token might not be the same as the top candidate token at each step. Specify the number of candidates to return by using an integer value in the range of `1` - `20` .

You must enable [`responseLogprobs`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/reference/models/inference#responseLogprobs) to use this parameter.

`audioTimestamp`

Optional: `boolean`

Available for the following models:

  - Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite
  - Gemini 2.0 Flash

Enables timestamp understanding for audio-only files.

This is a preview feature.

`thinkingConfig`

Optional: `object`

Configuration for the model's [thinking process](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/models/thinking) for Gemini 2.5 and higher models.

The `thinkingConfig` object contains the following fields:

  - `thinkingBudget` : `integer` . By default, the model automatically controls how much it thinks up to a maximum of `8,192` tokens.
  - `thinkingLevel` : `enum` . Controls the amount of internal reasoning the model performs before generating a response. Higher levels may improve quality on complex tasks but increase latency and cost. Supported values are `MINIMAL` , `LOW` , `MEDIUM` , and `HIGH` (support varies by model).

`mediaResolution`

Optional: `MediaResolution`

Controls how input media is processed. `LOW` reduces tokens per image/video, possibly losing detail but allowing longer videos in context. Supported values: `HIGH` , `MEDIUM` , `LOW` .
