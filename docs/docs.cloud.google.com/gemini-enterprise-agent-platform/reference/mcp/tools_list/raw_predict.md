## Tool: `raw_predict`

Perform online predictions with lower overhead for latency-sensitive applications. This tool allows for raw input/output formats, bypassing some of the standard Agent Platform request/response formatting.

The following sample demonstrate how to use `curl` to invoke the `raw_predict` MCP tool.

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Curl Request</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><pre dir="ltr" data-is-upgraded="" data-syntax="Bash" translate="no"><code>

## Input Schema

Request message for `PredictionService.RawPredict` .

### RawPredictRequest

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />

<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>JSON representation</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><pre dir="ltr" data-is-upgraded="" style="border: 0;margin: 0;" translate="no"><code>{&quot;endpoint&quot;: string,&quot;httpBody&quot;: {object (HttpBody)}}</code></pre></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Fields

`endpoint`

`string`

Required. The name of the Endpoint requested to serve the prediction. Format: `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/endpoints/{endpoint}`

`httpBody`

` object ( HttpBody  ` )

The prediction input. Supports HTTP headers and arbitrary data payload.

A `  DeployedModel  ` may have an upper limit on the number of instances it supports per request. When this limit it is exceeded for an AutoML model, the `RawPredict` method returns an error. When this limit is exceeded for a custom-trained model, the behavior varies depending on the model.

You can specify the schema for each instance in the `predict_schemata.instance_schema_uri` field when you create a `Model` . This schema applies when you deploy the `Model` as a `DeployedModel` to an `  Endpoint  ` and use the `RawPredict` method.

      field1: ...,
      ...
    }
  ]
}</code></pre></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Fields

`contentType`

`string`

The HTTP Content-Type header value specifying the content type of the body.

`data`

`string ( bytes format)`

The HTTP request/response body as raw binary.

A base64-encoded string.

`extensions[]`

`object`

Application specific response metadata. Must be set in the first response for streaming APIs.

An object containing fields of an arbitrary type. An additional field `"@type"` contains a URI identifying the type. Example: `{ "id": 1234, "@type": "types.example.com/standard/id" }` .

  &quot;typeUrl&quot;: string,
  &quot;value&quot;: string
}</code></pre></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Fields

`typeUrl`

`string`

Identifies the type of the serialized Protobuf message with a URI reference consisting of a prefix ending in a slash and the fully-qualified type name.

Example: type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.StringValue

This string must contain at least one `/` character, and the content after the last `/` must be the fully-qualified name of the type in canonical form, without a leading dot. Do not write a scheme on these URI references so that clients do not attempt to contact them.

The prefix is arbitrary and Protobuf implementations are expected to simply strip off everything up to and including the last `/` to identify the type. `type.googleapis.com/` is a common default prefix that some legacy implementations require. This prefix does not indicate the origin of the type, and URIs containing it are not expected to respond to any requests.

All type URL strings must be legal URI references with the additional restriction (for the text format) that the content of the reference must consist only of alphanumeric characters, percent-encoded escapes, and characters in the following set (not including the outer backticks): `/-.~_!$&()*+,;=` . Despite our allowing percent encodings, implementations should not unescape them to prevent confusion with existing parsers. For example, `type.googleapis.com%2FFoo` should be rejected.

In the original design of `Any` , the possibility of launching a type resolution service at these type URLs was considered but Protobuf never implemented one and considers contacting these URLs to be problematic and a potential security issue. Do not attempt to contact type URLs.

`value`

`string ( bytes format)`

Holds a Protobuf serialization of the type described by type\_url.

A base64-encoded string.

## Output Schema

Message that represents an arbitrary HTTP body. It should only be used for payload formats that can't be represented as JSON, such as raw binary or an HTML page.

This message can be used both in streaming and non-streaming API methods in the request as well as the response.

It can be used as a top-level request field, which is convenient if one wants to extract parameters from either the URL or HTTP template into the request fields and also want access to the raw HTTP body.

Example:

    message GetResourceRequest {
      // A unique request id.
      string request_id = 1;
    
      // The raw HTTP body is bound to this field.
      google.api.HttpBody http_body = 2;
    
    }
    
    service ResourceService {
      rpc GetResource(GetResourceRequest)
        returns (google.api.HttpBody);
      rpc UpdateResource(google.api.HttpBody)
        returns (google.protobuf.Empty);
    
    }

Example with streaming methods:

    service CaldavService {
      rpc GetCalendar(stream google.api.HttpBody)
        returns (stream google.api.HttpBody);
      rpc UpdateCalendar(stream google.api.HttpBody)
        returns (stream google.api.HttpBody);
    
    }

Use of this type only changes how the request and response bodies are handled, all other features will continue to work unchanged.
