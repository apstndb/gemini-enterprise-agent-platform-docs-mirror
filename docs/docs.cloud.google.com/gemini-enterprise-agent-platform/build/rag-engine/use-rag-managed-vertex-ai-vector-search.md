> **Preview**
> 
> Some of the RAG features are Preview offerings, subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" of the [Google Cloud Service Specific Terms](https://cloud.google.com/terms/service-terms) . Pre-GA products and features are available "as-is" and may have limited support, and changes to Pre-GA products and features may not be compatible with other Pre-GA versions. For more information, see the [launch stage descriptions](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages) . By using the Gemini API on Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform, you agree to the Generative AI Preview [terms and conditions](https://cloud.google.com/trustedtester/aitos) (Preview Terms).

> The [VPC-SC security controls](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/models/security-controls) and CMEK are supported by Agent Platform RAG Engine. Data residency and AXT security controls aren't supported.

> RAG Engine corpora that are backed by Vector Search 2.0 are available only in `us-central1` .

This page shows you how Vertex AI RAG Engine uses [Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform Vector Search 2.0](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/vector-search-2/overview) , which is a Google Cloud product that serves as a comprehensive storage and retrieval system to store and manage vector representations of your documents. The Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform Vector Search 2.0 is then used to retrieve relevant documents based on the document's semantic similarity to a given query.

RAG will manage the Vector Search 2.0 collections for you and you will have full access to the Vector Search 2.0 collections in your project.

## Choosing a RAG backend

When using Vertex AI RAG Engine, you can choose between different backend storage options for your RAG corpora. The following table summarizes the key differences:

| Backend Option                 | Underlying Technology                              | Management by RAG Engine                                                         | Data Visibility in Project           | CMEK Support |
| :----------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------- | :----------- |
| `RagManagedVertexVectorSearch` | Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform Vector Search 2.0 | Fully managed by Google.                                                         | Visible in your Google Cloud project | No           |
| `VertexVectorSearch`           | Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform Vector Search 1.0 | User is expected to set up, manage, and clean up the Vector Search 1.0 instance. | Visible in your Google Cloud project | No           |
| `RagManagedDb`                 | Spanner                                            | Fully managed by Google.                                                         | Not directly visible in your project | Yes          |

Choose `RagManagedVertexVectorSearch` for the latest features, automated management, and transparency into your Vector Search 2.0 data. If CMEK support is a strict requirement, consider `RagManagedDb` , keeping in mind the lack of direct visibility into the backend database.

## Enable Vector Search API

To use RAG Managed Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform Vector Search, you need to first enable the [Vector Search API](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/vectorsearch.googleapis.com/) .

### Create a RAG corpus with `RagManagedVertexVectorSearch`

This code samples demonstrates how to create a RAG corpus using `RagManagedVertexVectorSearch` .

### Python

    from vertexai.preview import rag
    import vertexai
    
    PROJECT_ID = YOUR_PROJECT_ID
    LOCATION = YOUR_RAG_ENGINE_LOCATION
    DISPLAY_NAME = YOUR_RAG_CORPUS_DISPLAY_NAME
    
    # Initialize Agent Platform API once per session
    vertexai.init(project=PROJECT_ID, location=LOCATION)
    
    vector_db = rag.RagManagedVertexVectorSearch()
    rag_corpus = rag.create_corpus(
        display_name=DISPLAY_NAME, backend_config=rag.RagVectorDbConfig(vector_db=vector_db))

### REST

Replace the following variables:

  - **PROJECT\_ID** : Your project ID.
  - **LOCATION** : The region to process the request.
  - **CORPUS\_DISPLAY\_NAME** : The display name of the RAG corpus.

<!-- end list -->

    PROJECT_ID=PROJECT_ID
    LOCATION=LOCATION
    CORPUS_DISPLAY_NAME=CORPUS_DISPLAY_NAME
    
    curl -X POST \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    https://${LOCATION}-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1beta1/projects/${PROJECT_ID}/locations/${LOCATION}/ragCorpora \
    -d '{
          "display_name" : '\""${CORPUS_DISPLAY_NAME}"\"',
          "vector_db_config": {
            "rag_managed_vertex_vector_search": {}
          }
        }'

### Importing your data into `RagManagedVertexVectorSearch`

You can use either the `ImportRagFiles` API or the `UploadRagFile` API to import your data into the `RagManagedVertexVectorSearch` .

To upload your local file into your RAG corpus, see [Upload a RAG file](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/reference/rest/v1beta1/projects.locations.ragCorpora.ragFiles/upload) . To import data into your RAG corpus, see the following code sample that demonstrates how to import from Cloud Storage. To learn about the supported data sources, see [Data sources supported for RAG](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/build/rag-engine/use-data-ingestion#supported-data-sources) .

### Python

    from vertexai.preview import rag
    import vertexai
    
    PROJECT_ID = YOUR_PROJECT_ID
    LOCATION = YOUR_RAG_ENGINE_LOCATION
    CORPUS_ID = YOUR_CORPUS_ID
    PATHS = ["gs://my_bucket/my_files_dir"]
    
    # Initialize Agent Platform API once per session
    vertexai.init(project=PROJECT_ID, location=LOCATION)
    
    corpus_name = f"projects/{PROJECT_ID}/locations/{LOCATION}/ragCorpora/{CORPUS_ID}"
    # This is a non blocking call.
    response = await rag.import_files_async(
        corpus_name=corpus_name,
        paths=PATHS,
    )
    
    # Wait for the import to complete.
    await response.result()

### REST

    GCS_URI=GCS_URI
    
    curl -X POST \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    https://${LOCATION}-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1beta1/projects/${PROJECT_ID}/locations/${LOCATION}/ragCorpora/${CORPUS_ID}/ragFiles:import \
    -d '{
      "import_rag_files_config": {
        "gcs_source": {
          "uris": '\""${GCS_URI}"\"',
          },
      }
    }'
