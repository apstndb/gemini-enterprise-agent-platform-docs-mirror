Deployment modes are a project-level configuration. Switching between the two modes doesn't move or delete your data from the other mode. You can use the `UpdateRagEngineConfig` API to switch between the Serverless and Spanner deployment modes. You can also use this API to set the tier on your Spanner deployment mode or to unprovision your Spanner mode to stop billing. You can use the `GetRagEngineConfig` API to read your current deployment mode information.

## Switching to Serverless mode

The following code samples demonstrate how to switch your `RagEngineConfig` to Serverless mode:

### Console

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **RAG Engine** page.
2.  Select the region in which your RAG Engine is running.
3.  Click the **Switch to Serverless** option. It might not be visible if you're on Serverless mode. You can verify your current mode from the mode label at the top right section of the page.

### REST

    PROJECT_ID: Your project ID.
    LOCATION: The region to process the request.

    curl -X PATCH \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
    https://LOCATION-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1beta1/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION/ragEngineConfig -d "{'ragManagedDbConfig': {'serverless': {}}}"

### Python

    from vertexai.preview import rag
    import vertexai
    
    PROJECT_ID = YOUR_PROJECT_ID
    LOCATION = YOUR_RAG_ENGINE_LOCATION
    
    # Initialize Agent Platform API once per session
    vertexai.init(project=PROJECT_ID, location=LOCATION)
    
    rag_engine_config_name=f"projects/{PROJECT_ID}/locations/{LOCATION}/ragEngineConfig"
    
    new_rag_engine_config = rag.RagEngineConfig(
        name=rag_engine_config_name,
        rag_managed_db_config=rag.RagManagedDbConfig(mode=rag.Serverless()),
    )
    
    updated_rag_engine_config = rag.rag_data.update_rag_engine_config(
        rag_engine_config=new_rag_engine_config
    )
    
    print(updated_rag_engine_config)

## Switching to Spanner mode

The following code samples demonstrate how to switch your `RagEngineConfig` to Spanner mode. If you've previously used Spanner mode, and have chosen a tier, you don't need to provide it explicitly while switching. If not, refer to the lower code examples on how to switch to Spanner mode while providing a tier.

### Console

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **RAG Engine** page.
2.  Select the region in which your RAG Engine is running.
3.  Click the **Switch to Spanner** option. It might not be visible if you're on Spanner mode. You can verify your current mode from the mode label.

### REST

    PROJECT_ID: Your project ID.
    LOCATION: The region to process the request.

    curl -X PATCH \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
    https://LOCATION-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1beta1/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION/ragEngineConfig -d "{'ragManagedDbConfig': {'spanner': {}}}"

### Python

    from vertexai.preview import rag
    import vertexai
    
    PROJECT_ID = YOUR_PROJECT_ID
    LOCATION = YOUR_RAG_ENGINE_LOCATION
    
    # Initialize Agent Platform API once per session
    vertexai.init(project=PROJECT_ID, location=LOCATION)
    
    rag_engine_config_name=f"projects/{PROJECT_ID}/locations/{LOCATION}/ragEngineConfig"
    
    new_rag_engine_config = rag.RagEngineConfig(
        name=rag_engine_config_name,
        rag_managed_db_config=rag.RagManagedDbConfig(mode=rag.Spanner()),
    )
    
    updated_rag_engine_config = rag.rag_data.update_rag_engine_config(
        rag_engine_config=new_rag_engine_config
    )
    
    print(updated_rag_engine_config)

## Read your current RagEngineConfig

The following code samples demonstrate how to read your `RagEngineConfig` to see what mode and tier is chosen:

    https://LOCATION-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1beta1/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION/ragEngineConfig

### Python

    from vertexai.preview import rag
    import vertexai
    
    PROJECT_ID = YOUR_PROJECT_ID
    LOCATION = YOUR_RAG_ENGINE_LOCATION
    
    # Initialize Agent Platform API once per session
    vertexai.init(project=PROJECT_ID, location=LOCATION)
    
    rag_engine_config = rag.rag_data.get_rag_engine_config(
        name=f"projects/{PROJECT_ID}/locations/{LOCATION}/ragEngineConfig"
    )
    
    print(rag_engine_config)
